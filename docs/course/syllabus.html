<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Course Textbook</p>
<p>There is no text book required for this course.</p>
<p>All material will either be provided through Canvas, or from the AWS Academy.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="course-structure">Course Structure</h2>
<p>This course utilized material from AWS Academy. There are ten modules that will be completed within AWS Academy. You will also be completing additional labs as listed in Canvas.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Subject to Change</p>
<p>Keep in mind that your instructor may deviate somewhat from the following guide, and they have final say on assignment requirements, delivery methods, and due dates. So be sure to pay attention to both in-class, MS Teams, and Canvas announcements.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Time Expectations</p>
<p>University guidelines suggest that students spend an average of three hours per week per credit hour.</p>
<p>While there will be some time provided in class for team assignments for campus students, as this is a three credit course, the expectation is that students will spend an average of six hours per week on assignments outside of class, including the time spent on preparation readings.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="reading-assignments-and-self-assessment-quizzes">Reading Assignments and Self-Assessment Quizzes</h3>
<p>Participation in class, attendance, and completing assigned reading prior to class will be assessed.</p>
<h4 id="knowledge-checks-and-test-preparation-quizzes">Knowledge Checks and Test Preparation Quizzes</h4>
<p>Each section has a knowledge check associated with it. You may take the knowledge checks as many times as necessary to pass. Once a knowledge check is passed, you must upload an image of the knowledge check results to Canvas to receive points.</p>
<p>There are pop-quizzes that will be given throughout the semester. These quizzes are intented to help you prepare for the AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification exam.</p>
<h4 id="labs">Labs</h4>
<p>There are assigned labs within AWS Academy as well as additional labs provided by your instructor. Labs within AWS Academy have step-by-step instructions. However, <em>services change often</em>, so some instructions may be out-of-date. You may need to use your own intuition and other resourses to find how to proceed if things have changed.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Instructor Labs</p>
<p>Instructor labs are not always step-by-step. You will need to utilize knowledge gained from AWS Academy labs as well as other online resources to complete the labs. You may work in teams for the labs and review previous labs for assistance.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="mid-term-project">Mid-term Project</h4>
<p>Half-way through the semester, you will complete a mid-term project. This project will require you to provision cloud services and host a website. </p>
<h3 id="final">Final</h3>
<p>You may take the AWS Cloud Practitioner certification exam in lieu of the final. If you take the AWS and pass, you will automatically receive 100% for the final. </p>
<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>
<p>See your Canvas section for exact grade weights for each assignment, but in general, assignments are weighted similar to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reading Assignments and Self-Assessment Quizzes: 20%</li>
<li>Knowledge Checks and Test Preparation Quizzes: 15%</li>
<li>Labs: 30%</li>
<li>Mid-term Project: 10%</li>
<li>Final: 25%</li>
</ul>
<p>Final Letter grades are given according to the <a href="https://www.byui.edu/student-records/grades/grading-system">standard BYU-Idaho grading scale</a>.</p>
<h2 id="late-policy">Late Policy</h2>
<p>Because of the team-based, interactive nature of this course, no late credit is given. </p>
<p>In the event of an <em>extreme emergency</em> that prevents you from communicating with your team, your instructor will work with you to come up with a way for you to make up the content of a given module.</p>
<h2 id="dress-and-grooming">Dress and Grooming</h2>
<p>You are expected to follow the university's <a href="http://www.byui.edu/student-honor-office/ces-honor-code/dress-and-grooming">Dress and Grooming Standards</a></p>
<p>This includes any <a href="https://www.byui.edu/covid-19-updates">current university requirements and/or guidelines</a> related to wearing masks and/or social distancing.</p>
<h2 id="preventing-sexual-misconduct">Preventing Sexual Misconduct</h2>
<p>BYU-Idaho prohibits sex discrimination by its employees and students in all of its education programs or activities. This includes all forms of sexual harassment, such as sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, stalking, conditioning a grade or job on participation in sexual conduct, and other forms of unwelcome sexual conduct.</p>
<p>As an instructor, one of my responsibilities is to help create a safe learning environment for my students and for the campus as a whole. University policy requires deans and department chairs, and encourages all faculty, to report every incident of sexual harassment that comes to their attention. If you encounter or experience sexual harassment, please contact the Title IX Coordinator at <a href="mailto:titleix@byui.edu">titleix@byui.edu</a> or 208-496-9209. Additional information about sex discrimination, sexual harassment, and available resources can be found at <a href="www.byui.edu/titleix">www.byui.edu/titleix</a></p>
<h2 id="disability-services">Disability Services</h2>
<p>BYU-Idaho does not discriminate against persons with disabilities in providing its educational and administrative services and programs and follows applicable federal and state law. This policy extends to the University’s electronic and information technologies (EIT).</p>
<p>Students with qualifying disabilities should contact the Disability Services Office at disabilityservices@byui.edu or 208-496-9210. Additional information about Disability Services resources can be found at <a href="http://www.byui.edu/disabilities">http://www.byui.edu/disabilities</a>.</p>
<h2 id="academic-honesty">Academic Honesty</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“When you are honest in every way, you are able to enjoy peace of mind and maintain self-respect. You build strength of character, which allows you to be of service to God and others. You are trustworthy in the eyes of God and those around you. If you are dishonest in your words or actions, you hurt yourself and often hurt others as well. If you lie, steal, cheat, or neglect to give the full amount of work for your pay, you lose your self-respect. You lose the guidance of the Holy Ghost” (“Honesty,” True to the Faith (2004), 84)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Academic Honesty means students do their own work. This also means their instructors will evaluate that work. Students should not be dishonest—this includes all types of work in their courses. The complete Academic Honesty Policy can be found at <a href="http://www.byui.edu/student-honor-office/ces-honor-code/academic-honesty">http://www.byui.edu/student-honor-office/ces-honor-code/academic-honesty</a>.</p>
<h2 id="academic-grievances">Academic Grievances</h2>
<p>Students are encouraged to contact their instructors regarding course-related concerns. If concerns cannot be resolved in this way, students may contact the <a href="http://www.byui.edu/contact-us">BYU-Idaho Support Center</a>. to formally register a concern or grievance. The <a href="https://content.byui.edu/integ/gen/d42e66fd-6e72-448f-a4c2-4d88a4ed26d2/0/Final%20Student%20Grievance%20Policy%20-%20catalog%20version.docx">Student Grievance Policy</a>. can be found here.</p>
<h2 id="changes-to-schedule-and-assignments">Changes to Schedule and Assignments</h2>
<p>Schedules, assignments, and policies are subject to change. You will be notified of any changes on I-learn.</p>
