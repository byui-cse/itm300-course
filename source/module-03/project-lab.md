## Product Objective

You will be connecting your website with AWS Cognito. Cognito will allow you to register users, store usernames and passwords, and login and logout. For this lab we'll be creating cognito user pool, create users, learn about the hosted UI, and connect the website to cognito to allow us to get a JWT token after authenticating with cognito.
