## Module 07 - Overview

In our final module, we'll discuss various topics in machine learning that we haven't had time to cover earlier, including next steps for those of you who are interested in doing more with it in the future.

### Project

This module will not have a traditional team-based case study as in other modules, instead, you'll have a chance to demonstrate your skills with a small individual project of your choosing.
